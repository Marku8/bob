## AWS Architecture Overview

hi this is Mark Below is a high-level architecture diagram and a description of each component.

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **Description**: A logically isolated network within AWS where resources are launched. 

### Public Subnet
- **Description**: Accessible from the internet, hosts public-facing resources like web servers.
- **Routing**: Uses route tables to direct outbound traffic through the Internet Gateway (IGW).

### Private Subnet
- **Description**: Hosts internal resources such as backend servers, enhancing security by restricting public internet access.
- **Routing**: Outbound traffic is directed through the NAT Gateway.

### Internet Gateway (IGW)
- **Purpose**: Allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet.

### NAT Gateway
- **Purpose**: Enables instances in the private subnet to access the internet for outbound traffic while blocking inbound traffic.

### EC2 Instance
- **Purpose**: Hosts applications and handles workloads within the VPC.

### S3 Bucket
- **Purpose**: Object storage service used for storing CloudTrail logs and other data securely.

### CloudTrail
- **Purpose**: Provides governance, compliance, and auditing by logging and retaining account activity across the AWS infrastructure.

### Security Groups and Network ACLs
- **Function**: Act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic to resources, enhancing security at both instance and subnet levels.

### Route Tables
- **Function**: Manage traffic routing within the VPC, directing traffic between subnets, gateways, and other endpoints.

## Security Considerations
- **Public Subnet Access**: Ensure that only necessary ports are open using security groups.
- **Private Subnet Security**: Utilize security groups and network ACLs to manage traffic and enhance security.

## Terraform Infrastructure as Code
Terraform is utilized to ensure infrastructure is consistently and reliably deployed. Below is the project structure and a brief overview of each module.

### Terraform Project Structure
```
|-- main.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- outputs.tf
```

### Module Descriptions
- **VPC Module**: Configures VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT gateway, and route tables.
- **EC2 Module**: Manages EC2 instance configurations.
- **S3 Module**: Handles S3 bucket configurations for logging and storage.
- **CloudTrail Module**: Sets up CloudTrail for logging and monitoring.

### Usage
To deploy this infrastructure:
1. Initialize Review planned Apply configuration Terraform environment:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```


### Next Steps
- **Deploy the Infrastructure**: Execute the Terraform scripts to build the environment.
- **Review and Test Security Configurations**: Ensure that all components meet security requirements and adjust as necessary.
- **Document Adjustments**: Record any changes or additional measures needed to secure and optimize the infrastructure.
